# Localisation Techniques for fleets of Connected Autonomous Vehicles
Vehicle tracking using LIDAR data processing with OpenCV, PCL and ROS

## Information
This project aims to create a robust system to track and identify cars/object. It is made to provide positional data for a fleet of **Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)** (modelled using Raspberry-Pi robot cars).

As shown below, the robot cars are moving around a figure 8 track with one junction to navigate through. Using LIDAR data and ultrasonic sensors, the cars are able to navigate through junction without crashing.

The robot car used in this project is the SunFounder PiCar-S. Here is a gif of the program in action.
